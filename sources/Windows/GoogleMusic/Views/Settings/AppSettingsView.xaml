                Windows does not detect any user activity for a certain amount of time.

                By default outcoldplayer stores cache files in hidden application folder on the same drive where Windows is located.
                If your Music Library folde is located on separate drive (remote device for example) you may consider moving outcoldplayer 
                cache to the Music Library folder. New hidden folder will be created with name .outcoldplayer.cache for that. 
                Don't manually change anything for this folder, it can break player.

                Higher stream bitrate means higher quality, but it uses more data over internet to download songs and more storage to keep streams offline, also higher bitrate can increase loading times.
                Sometimes it is very hard to hear difference between 192 and 256kpbs on regular headphones or strereo systems. We beleive that 256kbps is an optimal quality.
